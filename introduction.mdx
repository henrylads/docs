## Welcome

**Clariti** is an AI-powered specification tool for structural engineers and architects working with construction products. Clariti streamlines the process of specifying cast-in anchor channels by combining intelligent optimization with standards-compliant calculations.

## Supported Products

Clariti currently supports the following cast-in anchor channel systems:

| Channel Family | Description                          | ETA Reference |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| CPRO38         | Light-duty channel                   | ETA-25/0222   |
| CPRO50         | Medium-duty channel                  | ETA-25/0222   |
| CPRO52         | Heavy-duty channel                   | ETA-25/0222   |
| CPRO52S        | Heavy-duty channel (stainless steel) | ETA-25/0222   |
| ATA40          | Light-duty hot-rolled channel (HDG)  | ETA-25/0429   |
| ATA50          | Medium-duty hot-rolled channel (HDG) | ETA-25/0429   |
| ATA52          | Heavy-duty hot-rolled channel (HDG)  | ETA-25/0429   |

Each channel family includes multiple variants (e.g., CPRO38-1850, ATA50-550) with different dimensions and load capacities. Select the appropriate variant during design configuration based on your specific requirements.
