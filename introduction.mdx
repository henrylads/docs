## Welcome

**Clariti** is an AI-powered specification tool for structural engineers and architects working with construction products. Clariti streamlines the process of specifying cast-in anchor channels by combining intelligent optimization with standards-compliant calculations.

## Supported Products

Clariti currently supports the following cast-in anchor channel systems:

| Channel Family | Description                        | Use Case                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CPRO38         | Light-duty channel                 | Lower load applications         |
| CPRO50         | Medium-duty channel                | Standard commercial applications|
| CPRO52         | Heavy-duty channel                 | High load industrial applications|
| CPRO52S        | Heavy-duty channel (stainless steel)| Corrosive environments         |

Each channel family includes multiple variants (e.g., CPRO38-1850) with different dimensions and load capacities. Select the appropriate variant during design configuration based on your specific requirements.
