## What is Clariti?

**Clariti** is an AI-powered specification tool for structural engineers working with anchor channels and cast-in fixings. It automates the complex calculations required by EN 1992-4, helping you specify compliant connections in minutes rather than hours.

### Key Benefits

- **Standards-compliant calculations** — Full EN 1992-4 verification with transparent methodology
- **Intelligent optimization** — AI suggests optimal channel sizes and configurations
- **Real-time 3D visualization** — See your connections in context before specifying
- **Instant documentation** — Generate professional specification reports automatically

## How It Works

Clariti handles the complete specification workflow:

  <Card title="1. Define Loading" icon="pencil">
    Enter your design loads — tension, shear, and moment. Clariti supports
    all standard load combinations per Eurocode.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Select Products" icon="puzzle">
    Choose from our database of certified anchor channels. Filter by
    manufacturer, material, and load capacity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Verify Design" icon="check">
    Automatic EN 1992-4 verification checks all failure modes: steel failure,
    concrete cone, pullout, splitting, and pryout.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Export Results" icon="file">
    Generate calculation reports with full transparency — every equation,
    every factor, every check documented.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. ### Create Your Account

   Sign up at [clariti.site](https://clariti.site) to access the specification tool.

2. ### Start a New Project

   Create a project and define your base concrete parameters — strength class,
   exposure, and edge distances.

3. ### Add Your First Connection

   Input your design loads and let Clariti suggest suitable channel options.

4. ### Review and Export

   Verify the calculations, adjust if needed, and export your specification report.

</Steps>

## Standards Coverage

Clariti currently supports design verification to:

- **EN 1992-4:2018** — Design of fastenings for use in concrete
- **ETAG 001** — Guideline for European Technical Approval (legacy support)

Support for additional standards (ACI 318, AS 5216) is planned for future releases.
