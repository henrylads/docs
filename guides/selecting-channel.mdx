Selecting the appropriate anchor channel involves balancing capacity, cost, material, and practical considerations. This guide helps you make informed choices.

## Selection Criteria

When choosing an anchor channel, consider:

1. **Load capacity** — Must exceed design demands
2. **Material compatibility** — Match exposure conditions
3. **Geometric fit** — Profile must suit member thickness
4. **Availability** — Product accessible in your region
5. **Cost efficiency** — Appropriate for application

## Step 1: Determine Required Capacity

### Review Your Design Loads

From your structural analysis:

- N<sub>Ed</sub> — Design tension (kN)
- V<sub>Ed</sub> — Design shear (kN)

### Account for All Load Cases

Different load combinations may govern:

- Dead + live
- Dead + wind
- Seismic combinations
- Accidental cases

<Tip>
  Enter all relevant load cases in Clariti. The tool identifies which case governs for each failure mode.

## Step 2: Match Material to Environment

### Exposure Classes

| EN 206 Class | Environment       | Recommended Material   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| XC1          | Dry interior      | HDG steel              |
| XC2          | Wet, rarely dry   | HDG steel or stainless |
| XC3          | Moderate humidity | Stainless steel        |
| XC4          | Cyclic wet/dry    | Stainless steel        |
| XD/XS        | Deicing/marine    | High-grade stainless   |

<Warning>
  Don't mix materials in a connection. Galvanic corrosion occurs when dissimilar metals contact in the presence of moisture.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Check Geometric Compatibility

### Member Thickness

The concrete member must be thick enough for:

- Full embedment depth (h<sub>ef</sub>)
- Cover to reinforcement
- Fire protection requirements

```
Required thickness ≥ hef + cover + margin
```

### Edge Distance Check

Compare your edge distances to critical values:

```
If c ≥ ccr,N = 1.5 × hef → No reduction
If c < ccr,N → Capacity reduced
```

Channels with larger h<sub>ef</sub> require larger edge distances for full capacity.

## Step 4: Verify Selection

### Check All Failure Modes

Don't just look at overall utilization. Review each mode:

- Is one mode much higher than others?
- Are edge-related modes critical?
- Is steel or concrete governing?

### Review Warnings

Clariti flags potential issues:

- Close edge distances
- Spacing interactions
- Member thickness concerns
- Material recommendations

### Consider Constructability

- Can the channel be placed accurately?
- Is there reinforcement conflict?
- Can the T-bolt be accessed for tightening?
- Is the channel length practical?

## Special Situations

### High Tension, Low Shear

Focus on:

- Concrete cone capacity
- Embedment depth (larger h<sub>ef</sub> helps)
- Supplementary reinforcement possibility

Consider deeper profile channels.

### High Shear Toward Edge

Focus on:

- Concrete edge capacity
- Edge distance (increase if possible)
- Edge reinforcement

Consider moving channel away from edge or adding reinforcement.

### Combined Loading

Focus on:

- Interaction equation
- Both tension and shear modes
- Multiple T-bolts to distribute load

Consider larger channels or multiple fixings.

### Limited Member Depth

Focus on:

- Shallow profile channels
- Splitting capacity
- Blow-out potential
