description: Recommendations for effective anchor channel specification with Clariti
---

This guide collects best practices for efficient, accurate anchor channel specification. Following these recommendations helps ensure quality designs and smooth project delivery.

## Project Organization

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent, descriptive names:

```
Project:    [Building] - [System/Element]
            "Tower A - Facade Brackets"
            "Podium Level 2 - Handrails"

Connection: [Type]-[Location]-[Sequence]
            "FB-03-01" (Facade Bracket, Level 3, #1)
            "HR-P2-12" (Handrail, Podium 2, #12)
```

Benefits:
- Easy to locate specific connections
- Clear cross-reference to drawings
- Logical sorting in lists

### Folder Structure

Organize larger projects:

```
Tower A Facade/
├── Level 01/
│   ├── FB-01-01
│   ├── FB-01-02
│   └── ...
├── Level 02/
├── Level 03/
└── Typical Details/
```

### Load Case Naming

Be explicit about load combinations:

```
Good:  "ULS: Dead + Wind (pressure)"
       "ULS: Dead + Wind (suction)"
       "SLS: Characteristic"

Bad:   "LC1", "LC2", "Case A"
```

## Input Quality

### Load Verification

Before entering loads:

- [ ] Loads are factored (design values, not characteristic)
- [ ] Load factors match your design code/NA
- [ ] All relevant combinations considered
- [ ] Load directions clearly defined
- [ ] Units verified (kN, not N or kN/m)

<Warning>
  Garbage in, garbage out. Clariti assumes your loads are correct design
  values. Verify your structural analysis before specifying fixings.
</Warning>

### Geometry Verification

Confirm dimensions against drawings:

- [ ] Edge distances measured correctly
- [ ] Member thickness accurate
- [ ] Coordinate system understood (which edge is c₁?)
- [ ] Channel orientation as intended

### Common Input Errors

| Error | Consequence | Prevention |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Unfactored loads | Unconservative design | Always use factored values |
| Wrong edge | Incorrect capacity | Sketch the connection |
| Units confusion | Order of magnitude error | Check units in inputs |
| Missing load case | Governing case missed | Review all combinations |

## Design Approach

### Start Conservative

Begin with:
- Cracked concrete (unless proven otherwise)
- No supplementary reinforcement credit
- Standard material factors

Refine only when needed and justified.

### Iterate Efficiently

When a design fails:

1. **Identify the cause** — Which mode governs?
2. **Target the solution** — Address that specific limitation
3. **Avoid brute force** — Don't just pick the biggest product

### Maintain Margin

Target 70-85% utilization:
- Provides tolerance for site variations
- Accommodates minor load changes
- Covers calculation uncertainties
- Allows for future modifications

### Standardize Where Possible

Use the same product throughout similar applications:
- Simpler procurement
- Reduced installation errors
- Easier quality control
- Bulk purchasing benefits

<Tip>
  Rather than optimize each connection individually, select one product
  that works for the typical case and verify it covers all locations.
</Tip>

## Documentation

### Record Your Assumptions

Document key decisions:
- Why cracked/uncracked was chosen
- Basis for load values
- Reason for material selection
- Any special considerations

### Version Control

Track changes:
- Save project before major modifications
- Note revision history
- Date all issued documents

### Export Appropriately

| Audience | Export Level |
|----------|--------------|
| Checking engineer | Full calculations |
| Building control | Standard report |
| Contractor | Summary + specification |
| Procurement | Product schedule |

## Quality Checks

### Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing:

- [ ] All load cases checked
- [ ] Governing mode makes sense
- [ ] Warnings addressed or justified
- [ ] Product available and appropriate
- [ ] Material matches exposure
- [ ] Calculations can be reproduced (traceability)

### Sanity Checks

Quick reasonableness tests:

| Check | Expectation |
|-------|-------------|
| Utilization spread | No mode much higher than 95% while others below 30% |
| Edge effects | Close edges should show reductions |
| Channel size | Larger profile = lower utilization |
| Material | Steel capacity ↑ with better grade |

### Peer Review

For critical applications:
- Have another engineer review Clariti outputs
- Spot-check key calculations manually
- Verify inputs against structural drawings
- Confirm product selection is sensible

## Coordination

### With Structural Engineer

Ensure:
- Concrete strength confirmed
- Reinforcement positions known
- Edge beam dimensions coordinated
- Post-tensioned zones identified

### With Architect

Verify:
- Edge distances achievable
- Channel positions don't conflict with finishes
- Exposed channels acceptable (if any)
- Access for T-bolt installation

### With Contractor

Communicate:
- Channel positions and tolerances
- Installation sequence requirements
- T-bolt torque specifications
- Concrete strength at installation

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Interaction

Individual mode checks pass, but combined fails.

**Prevention**: Always check the interaction utilization, not just individual modes.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Concrete Assumption

Using uncracked capacity without justification.

**Prevention**: Default to cracked. Only use uncracked when you can prove compression throughout service life.

### Mistake 3: Missing Load Cases

Designing for dead load only, missing wind suction.

**Prevention**: List all load combinations systematically before starting Clariti input.

### Mistake 4: Edge Distance Confusion

Measuring to wrong edge or using centerline vs. face.

**Prevention**: Sketch the connection with dimensions labeled. Clarify measurement conventions.

### Mistake 5: Material Mismatch

HDG channel with stainless T-bolt (galvanic corrosion).

**Prevention**: Match all components to the most demanding exposure requirement.

## Continuous Improvement

### Learn from Projects

After project completion:
- Review any site issues
- Note what worked well
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Update your standard details

### Stay Current

- Monitor EN 1992-4 updates
- Review new product releases
- Check Clariti feature updates
- Attend CPD on anchor design

### Build Your Library

Create templates for:
- Common connection types
- Standard project settings
- Preferred product selections
- Specification text formats

<Tip>
  A well-organized library of past projects accelerates future work
  and improves consistency across your practice.
