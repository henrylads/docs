Understanding Clariti's results helps you make confident design decisions. This guide explains how to read and interpret the verification output.

## Results Overview

Clariti presents results at three levels:

1. **Summary** — Pass/fail with key metrics
2. **Mode breakdown** — Each failure mode's utilization
3. **Detailed calculation** — Full equations and values

## Summary Panel

### Overall Status

The primary indicator:

| Status | Meaning                     | Action                   |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ✓ Pass | All checks satisfied        | Proceed to specification |
| ✗ Fail | One or more checks exceeded | Redesign required        |

### Utilization Indicator

The utilization bar shows:

- Percentage of capacity used
- Color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Governing mode highlighted

### Key Metrics

| Metric               | What It Shows               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Overall utilization  | Highest individual mode     |
| Governing mode       | Which failure type controls |
| Combined utilization | Interaction check result    |

## Mode Breakdown

### Tension Modes

| Mode          | What Fails           | Key Factors                           |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Steel failure | Anchor/channel steel | Steel grade, cross-section            |
| Concrete cone | Concrete breakout    | h<sub>ef</sub>, f<sub>ck</sub>, edges |
| Pullout       | Anchor bearing       | Product-specific, f<sub>ck</sub>      |
| Splitting     | Concrete splitting   | Thickness, edges, spacing             |

### Shear Modes

| Mode          | What Fails         | Key Factors              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Steel failure | Shear of steel     | Steel grade, diameter    |
| Concrete edge | Breakout to edge   | Edge distance, direction |
| Pryout        | Back-face breakout | Embedment depth          |

### Combined Check

Interaction between tension and shear demands.

## Reading Utilization Values

### Comparing Modes

Look at the spread between modes:

**Example A — Balanced Design:**

```
Steel tension:    45%
Concrete cone:    68%  ← Governing
Pullout:          52%
Splitting:        61%
```

All modes similar — well-balanced design.

**Example B — Single Mode Governing:**

```
Steel tension:    30%
Concrete cone:    92%  ← Governing
Pullout:          35%
Splitting:        55%
```

One mode much higher — design limited by concrete. Consider:

- Larger embedment depth
- Supplementary reinforcement
- Higher concrete strength

<Tip>
  When one mode dominates, address that specific limitation rather than simply selecting a larger channel.

## Warnings and Alerts

### Edge Distance Warnings

| Warning              | Meaning               | Action               |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| c \< c<sub>cr</sub>  | Edge causes reduction | Accept or increase c |
| c \< c<sub>min</sub> | Below minimum         | Must increase c      |

### Spacing Warnings

| Warning              | Meaning                  | Action               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| s \< s<sub>cr</sub>  | Spacing causes reduction | Accept or increase s |
| s \< s<sub>min</sub> | Below minimum            | Must increase s      |

### Member Thickness Warnings

| Warning              | Meaning        | Action               |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| h \< h<sub>min</sub> | Splitting risk | Increase h or verify |

### Calculation Structure

```
1. Reference clause (EN 1992-4 section)
2. Design equation
3. Input values
   - Geometry
   - Material properties
   - Product data
4. Reduction factors (ψ values)
   - Each factor with its calculation
   - Source of each value
5. Characteristic resistance (Rk)
6. Partial factor (γM)
7. Design resistance (Rd)
8. Utilization (Ed/Rd)
```

### Tracing Values

Every value shows its source:

- **[Input]** — Your entered value
- **[ETA]** — Product data from approval
- **[EN 1992-4]** — Standard reference
- **[Calculated]** — Derived from other values

## Understanding Factor Reductions

### Area Ratios (A<sub>c,N</sub>/A°<sub>c,N</sub>)

Reduced from 1.0 when:

- Edges are close (cone truncated)
- Multiple anchors (overlapping cones)
- Shallow members (depth limited)

### ψ Factors

| Factor           | Reduces for                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ψ<sub>s,N</sub>  | Close edges                    |
| ψ<sub>re,N</sub> | No supplementary reinforcement |
| ψ<sub>ec,N</sub> | Eccentric loading              |
| ψ<sub>h,V</sub>  | Shallow members (shear)        |
| ψ<sub>α,V</sub>  | Load angle to edge             |

### Cumulative Effect

Multiple factors multiply together:

```
NRd,c = N°Rk,c × (Ac,N/A°c,N) × ψs,N × ψre,N × ψec,N / γMc
```

If several factors are low, combined reduction is severe.

## Common Result Patterns

### Pattern 1: Edge-Limited Design

Symptoms:

- Concrete cone or edge failure governs
- Low ψ<sub>s</sub> values
- Warning about edge distances

Solutions:

- Increase edge distance if possible
- Add edge reinforcement
- Select deeper embedment channel

### Pattern 2: Steel-Limited Design

Symptoms:

- Steel failure governs
- High utilization on steel modes
- Concrete modes have large margin

Solutions:

- Select higher strength channel
- Use larger profile
- Consider multiple T-bolts

### Pattern 3: Interaction-Limited Design

Symptoms:

- Individual modes OK
- Combined check fails
- Moderate tension + moderate shear

Solutions:

- Distribute loads (multiple T-bolts)
- Select larger channel
- Reduce combined loading

### Pattern 4: Splitting-Limited Design

Symptoms:

- Splitting governs
- Thin member warning
- Edge or spacing issues

Solutions:

- Increase member thickness
- Select shallower channel
- Increase edge distances

## Acting on Results

### When Design Passes

1. Review governing mode — understand the limitation
2. Check margin — is there room for variation?
3. Consider warnings — any coordination needed?
4. Document — export calculation report

### When Design Fails

1. Identify failing mode(s)
2. Understand the cause (geometry, loads, product)
3. Consider options:
   - Different product
   - Geometry adjustment
   - Load redistribution
   - Multiple fixings
4. Re-run verification
5. Iterate until satisfactory

<Note>
  Don't just select larger products blindly. Understanding why a design fails helps you find efficient solutions.
