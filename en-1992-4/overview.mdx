description: Introduction to EN 1992-4 and its application in anchor channel design
---

EN 1992-4 is the European standard governing the design of fastenings for use in concrete. This page provides an overview of the standard and how Clariti implements it.

## What is EN 1992-4?

**EN 1992-4:2018** (*Design of fastenings for use in concrete*) is a harmonized European standard that defines:

- Design methods for concrete fasteners
- Verification procedures for all failure modes
- Partial safety factors and reliability requirements
- Product qualification criteria

It replaced the previous ETAG 001 guidelines and is part of the Eurocode system (specifically, part of EC2).

## Scope

The standard covers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cast-in Fasteners" icon="star">
    Anchor channels, headed studs, and other fasteners placed before concrete
    is poured. These are Clariti's primary focus.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Post-installed Fasteners" icon="star">
    Mechanical anchors, chemical anchors, and undercut anchors installed
    in hardened concrete.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What's Covered

- Fasteners under static, quasi-static, and fatigue loading
- Tension, shear, and combined loading
- Cracked and uncracked concrete
- Single fasteners and groups

### What's Not Covered

- Seismic design (see EN 1992-4 Annex C or national annexes)
- Fire design (see EN 1992-1-2)
- Fasteners in lightweight concrete (special provisions)
- Fibre reinforced concrete (requires additional guidance)

## Document Structure

EN 1992-4 is organized as follows:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1-3 | Scope, references, definitions |
| 4 | Basis of design |
| 5 | Determination of action effects |
| 6 | Cast-in headed fasteners |
| **7** | **Anchor channels** (primary Clariti reference) |
| 8 | Post-installed mechanical fasteners |
| 9 | Post-installed chemical fasteners |
| Annexes | National parameters, seismic provisions, testing |

<Note>
  Clariti focuses on **Section 7: Anchor channels**. For headed studs and
  post-installed anchors, refer to Sections 6, 8, and 9 respectively.
</Note>

## Design Philosophy

EN 1992-4 follows limit state design principles consistent with other Eurocodes:

### Ultimate Limit State (ULS)

Verification that the design resistance exceeds the design action:

```
Ed ≤ Rd

Where:
  Ed = design value of action (factored load)
  Rd = design value of resistance (factored capacity)
```

All failure modes must satisfy this inequality.

### Serviceability Limit State (SLS)

Verification of:
- Displacement limits
- Crack width control
- Durability requirements

<Tip>
  Clariti primarily addresses ULS verification. SLS checks (deflection,
  fatigue) may require additional analysis outside the tool.
</Tip>

## Material Assumptions

The standard assumes:

**Concrete:**
- Normal weight concrete (density 2000-2600 kg/m³)
- Strength classes C12/15 to C90/105
- Cracked or uncracked state

**Steel:**
- Carbon steel or stainless steel
- Defined by characteristic yield and ultimate strength
- Ductility requirements for certain applications

**Grout/Mortar:**
- Where applicable, must meet specified strength requirements

## Cracked vs. Uncracked Concrete

A critical design assumption:

| Condition | Assumption | When to Use |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Cracked | k₁ = 8.9 | Default — assume cracking occurs |
| Uncracked | k₁ = 12.7 | Only when cracking can be reliably excluded |

**Uncracked concrete** may be assumed only when:

- Tension zone is always in compression (prestressed elements)
- Detailed analysis proves no cracking occurs under SLS loads
- Member is designed to remain uncracked throughout its life

<Warning>
  Most structural applications should assume cracked concrete. Using
  uncracked values without justification is unconservative and may not
  be accepted by checking engineers.
</Warning>

## Product Qualification

Anchor channels must have:

- **ETA (European Technical Assessment)** — Product-specific approval
- **CE marking** — Conformity to European standards
- **Declaration of Performance** — Manufacturer's declared properties

Clariti only includes products with valid ETAs, ensuring all resistance values are certified and traceable.

## National Annexes

EN 1992-4 allows national variation through National Annexes (NAs). Key nationally determined parameters include:

- Partial safety factors (γ<sub>M</sub> values)
- Design working life assumptions
- Seismic provisions
- Additional requirements for specific applications

Clariti uses the recommended values from the base standard. Check your jurisdiction's National Annex for any modifications.

## Relationship to Other Standards

EN 1992-4 interfaces with:

| Standard | Interface |
|----------|-----------|
| EN 1990 | Basis of structural design, load combinations |
| EN 1991 | Actions on structures (load values) |
| EN 1992-1-1 | Concrete design (material properties) |
| EN 1993-1-1 | Steel design (for steel elements) |
| EN 1998-1 | Seismic design |

Design loads (N<sub>Ed</sub>, V<sub>Ed</sub>) come from EN 1991 analysis. Clariti focuses on the resistance side per EN 1992-4.

## Key Changes from ETAG 001

If you're familiar with the predecessor ETAG 001:

| Aspect | ETAG 001 | EN 1992-4 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Status | Guideline | Harmonized standard |
| Coverage | Separate documents | Single unified standard |
| Factors | Some differences | Updated γ<sub>M</sub> values |
| Methods | Equivalent | Refined equations |
| Reference | Being phased out | Current standard |

Clariti uses EN 1992-4 as the primary reference, with ETAG 001 compatibility for legacy projects where required.
