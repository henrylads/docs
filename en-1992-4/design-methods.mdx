description: The EN 1992-4 design method used by Clariti for anchor channel verification
---

Clariti uses **Method A** from EN 1992-4 — the full design method that provides the most accurate verification of anchor channel capacity.

## Method A — Full Design Method

Method A is the complete verification procedure covering all failure modes with detailed calculations. It provides the highest accuracy and is required for final design verification.

### Procedure

The method follows these steps:

1. **Determine effective geometry**
   - Embedment depth (hef)
   - Edge distances (c1, c2)
   - Spacing (s)
   - Member thickness (h)

2. **Calculate characteristic resistances**
   - Steel: NRk,s, VRk,s
   - Concrete cone: NRk,c
   - Pullout: NRk,p
   - Splitting: NRk,sp
   - Edge: VRk,c
   - Pryout: VRk,cp

3. **Apply reduction factors**
   - Area ratios (Ac,N/A°c,N)
   - ψ factors (edge, spacing, eccentricity, etc.)

4. **Apply partial safety factors**
   - NRd = NRk / γM
   - VRd = VRk / γM

5. **Verify design condition**
   - NEd ≤ NRd for all tension modes
   - VEd ≤ VRd for all shear modes

6. **Check interaction**
   - Combined tension-shear if applicable

### Why Method A

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Most accurate | Reflects actual anchor behavior |
| All failure modes | No modes overlooked |
| Geometric effects | Accounts for edges, spacing, thickness |
| Optimised designs | Avoids unnecessary conservatism |
| Full documentation | Complete audit trail for approvals |

<Note>
EN 1992-4 also defines simplified methods (B and C) for quick checks, but these are conservative and limited in scope. Clariti uses Method A exclusively to ensure accurate, optimised designs.
</Note>

## How Clariti Implements Method A

Clariti automates the full Method A procedure:

1. **Automatic geometry analysis** — Determines all relevant distances and checks constraints
2. **Complete mode checking** — Verifies all applicable tension and shear failure modes
3. **Factor calculation** — Computes all ψ reduction factors with justification
4. **Interaction verification** — Checks combined loading per EN 1992-4 Section 7.2.3
5. **Transparency** — Documents every step with EN 1992-4 clause references

This ensures designs are:
- Fully compliant with EN 1992-4
- Optimised for the specific geometry
- Documented for approval
