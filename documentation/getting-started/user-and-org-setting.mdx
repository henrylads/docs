## Organization Structure

Clariti uses an organization-based structure for collaboration. All team members belong to an organization (e.g., "CFS"), and sharing happens within this organizational context.

## Sharing Projects with Your Organization

To share a project with all members of your organization:

1. Navigate to the Projects list
2. Find the project you want to share
3. Click the Share icon (branching icon) next to the project
4. The project will now be visible to all organization members

Shared projects display a "Shared" label with a group icon, making it easy to identify collaborative work.

## Sharing Individual Designs

Designs can also be shared at the individual level:

1. Open the project containing the design
2. Find the design in the list
3. Click the Share icon next to the design name
4. The design will show "Shared" status instead of your name

## Understanding Sharing Status

In the designs list, the "Created by" column indicates sharing status:

- **"Shared" with group icon**: Visible to all organization members
- **User name with avatar**: Private to the creator (not shared with organization)
