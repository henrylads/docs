description: Complete walkthrough of creating a project and specifying a connection
---

This tutorial guides you through a complete specification workflow — from creating a project to exporting your final documentation.

## Scenario

We'll specify a facade bracket connection with the following requirements:

- **Application**: Steel bracket supporting a curtain wall mullion
- **Concrete**: C30/37, cracked conditions
- **Loading**: 15 kN tension, 8 kN shear (factored ULS values)
- **Edge distance**: 100mm from slab edge

## Step 1: Create the Project

<Steps>

1. ### Open Clariti

   Log in at [clariti.site](https://clariti.site) and click **New Project** from your dashboard.

2. ### Name Your Project

   Enter a descriptive name: "Facade Bracket - Level 03"

   Good project names help you find work later. Consider including:
   - Building or project reference
   - Location or level
   - Element type

3. ### Set Project Parameters

   Configure the base concrete properties:

   | Parameter | Value | Notes |
   |-----------|-------|-------|
   | Concrete class | C30/37 | Characteristic strength f<sub>ck</sub> = 30 MPa |
   | Condition | Cracked | Assume cracked unless proven otherwise |
   | Exposure | XC3 | Moderate humidity — typical for facades |

   <Tip>
     If you're unsure about cracked vs. uncracked, assume cracked. It's the
     conservative approach and covers most practical situations.
   </Tip>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Add a Connection

<Steps>

1. ### Create New Connection

   Click **+ Add Connection** in the project panel. A new connection appears in your project tree.

2. ### Rename It

   Double-click to rename: "Bracket B-03-01"

   A systematic naming convention helps when you have many connections:
   - B = Bracket
   - 03 = Level 3
   - 01 = First bracket on this level

3. ### Set Connection Type

   Select **Single channel** from the connection type options.

   Connection types available:
   - Single channel — one anchor channel
   - Channel pair — two parallel channels
   - Channel group — custom arrangement

</Steps>

## Step 3: Define Geometry

<Steps>

1. ### Member Thickness

   Enter the slab thickness: **200 mm**

   This affects:
   - Available embedment depth
   - Concrete cone breakout area
   - Splitting resistance

2. ### Edge Distances

   Define the distances from channel to concrete edges:

   | Edge | Distance | Location |
   |------|----------|----------|
   | c₁ | 100 mm | To slab edge (governs) |
   | c₂ | 500 mm | To adjacent edge |

   The 3D view updates to show your geometry. The warning indicator highlights that c₁ = 100mm may cause capacity reductions.

3. ### Channel Orientation

   Set the channel axis:
   - **Horizontal** — channel runs parallel to slab edge
   - Load direction: **Perpendicular** to channel axis

</Steps>

## Step 4: Enter Design Loads

<Steps>

1. ### Load Values

   Enter your factored ultimate limit state (ULS) loads:

   | Component | Value | Direction |
   |-----------|-------|-----------|
   | N<sub>Ed</sub> | 15 kN | Tension (away from concrete) |
   | V<sub>Ed</sub> | 8 kN | Shear (perpendicular to channel) |
   | M<sub>Ed</sub> | 0 kNm | No moment |

2. ### Load Case

   These loads are already factored. Select **ULS - STR** as the limit state.

   <Warning>
     Clariti expects factored design loads. Don't enter characteristic
     (unfactored) values — you'll get unconservative results.
   </Warning>

</Steps>

## Step 5: Select a Channel

The results panel now shows available channels ranked by utilization:

### Option 1: Manual Selection

Browse the product list filtered to your requirements:

1. **Filter by material**: Stainless steel (for facade exposure)
2. **Filter by manufacturer**: All (or select preferred supplier)
3. **Sort by**: Utilization (lowest first)

Click a product to see its detailed verification results.

### Option 2: AI Recommendation

Click **Optimize** to let Clariti suggest the best option:

The AI considers:
- Capacity vs. demand (target 70-85% utilization)
- Material suitability for exposure class
- Cost efficiency
- Commonly specified products for this application

For our scenario, Clariti recommends **CPRO 52/34** in stainless steel.

## Step 6: Review Results

With CPRO 52/34 selected, the results panel shows:

### Summary

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Overall | Pass |
| Utilization | 74% |
| Governing mode | Concrete cone (tension) |

### Detailed Verification

**Tension checks:**

| Failure Mode | N<sub>Rd</sub> | Utilization |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Steel failure | 45.2 kN | 33% |
| Concrete cone | 20.3 kN | **74%** |
| Pullout | 38.6 kN | 39% |
| Splitting | 24.8 kN | 60% |

**Shear checks:**

| Failure Mode | V<sub>Rd</sub> | Utilization |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Steel failure | 28.4 kN | 28% |
| Concrete edge | 35.1 kN | 23% |
| Pryout | 40.6 kN | 20% |

**Interaction check:**

Combined tension and shear: 68% (using linear interaction)

### View Calculation Details

Click **Concrete cone** to expand the full calculation:

```
Concrete Cone Failure - EN 1992-4 Section 7.2.1.4

N°Rd,c = N°Rk,c / γMc

where:
  N°Rk,c = k₁ · √fck · hef^1.5 · (Ac,N/A°c,N) · ψs,N · ψre,N · ψec,N

Input values:
  k₁ = 8.9 (cracked concrete)
  fck = 30 MPa
  hef = 47 mm (effective embedment)

Factors:
  Ac,N/A°c,N = 0.72 (edge distance reduction)
  ψs,N = 0.85 (spacing factor)
  ψre,N = 1.0 (no supplementary reinforcement)
  ψec,N = 1.0 (concentric loading)

Calculation:
  N°Rk,c = 8.9 × √30 × 47^1.5 × 0.72 × 0.85 × 1.0 × 1.0
  N°Rk,c = 30.45 kN

  γMc = 1.5

  N°Rd,c = 30.45 / 1.5 = 20.3 kN

Utilization:
  NEd / N°Rd,c = 15 / 20.3 = 74% ✓
```

## Step 7: Export Documentation

<Steps>

1. ### Generate Report

   Click **Export** → **PDF Report**

   Select what to include:
   - Project summary
   - Connection geometry
   - Loading summary
   - Full calculations
   - Product data sheet

2. ### Specification Text
