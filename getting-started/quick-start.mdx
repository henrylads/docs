This guide walks you through specifying your first anchor channel connection in Clariti.

## Prerequisites

- A Clariti account ([sign up here](https://clariti.site/signup))
- Basic knowledge of structural loading and anchor channel concepts
- Your design loads (tension and/or shear forces)

## Your First Specification

<Steps>
  1. **Log In and Create a Project**

     After logging in, click **New Project** from the dashboard. Give your project a name and description.
  2. **Create a Design**

     Within your project, create a new design. You'll need to select the product family you want to work with:
     - CPRO38
     - CPRO50
     - CPRO52
     - CPRO52S
  3. **Define Applied Loads**

     Enter the loads applied to the channel:
     - **Design loads** — tension and/or shear forces
     - **Number of fixing points** — how many t-bolts in the channel
  4. **Set Concrete Parameters**

     Configure your concrete geometry:
     - **Edge distances** — c₁₁, c₁₂, c₂₁, c₂₂
     - **Member thickness** — depth of concrete element

     <Tip>
       Edge distances significantly affect capacity. Clariti will warn you if your geometry causes reductions.
     </Tip>
  5. **Set Concrete Strength**

     Define the concrete properties:
     - **Concrete strength class** (e.g., C30/37)
     - **Concrete condition** — cracked or uncracked
  6. **Configure Reinforcement Options**

     Specify the reinforcement in your concrete element:
     - **Reinforcement density** — widely spaced or closely spaced
     - **Splitting reinforcement** — present or not
     - **Edge reinforcement** — present or not
  7. **Review Calculations**

     A pop-up will display a summary of your calculation results. To see the full breakdown, click on the **Results** panel at the top of the screen.
  8. **Export Your Specification**

     Once satisfied, export your work:
     - **PDF Report** — full calculation package for checking/approval
     - **3D Models** — download directly from the software
