This guide walks you through specifying your first anchor channel connection in Clariti.

## Prerequisites

- A Clariti account ([sign up here](https://clariti.site/signup))
- Basic knowledge of structural loading and anchor channel concepts
- Your design loads (tension and/or shear forces)

## Your First Specification

<Steps>
  1. **Log In and Create a Project**

     After logging in, click **New Project** from the dashboard. Give your project a name and description.
  2. **Create a Design**

     Within your project, create a new design. You'll need to configure the channel:
     - **Channel Family** — Select from CPRO38, CPRO50, CPRO52, or CPRO52S
     - **Variant** — Choose the specific channel variant (e.g., CPRO38-1850)
     - **Bolt Thread Size** — Select bolt size (e.g., M12)
  3. **Define Applied Loads**

     Enter the loads applied to the channel:
     - **Position (mm)** — Distance from the far left end of the channel
     - **Tension (kN)** — Applied tension force
     - **Shear (kN)** — Applied shear force
     - Click **+ Add Load** to add additional load points as needed
  4. **Set Concrete Parameters**

     Configure your concrete geometry:
     - **Edge distances** — c₁₁, c₁₂, c₂₁, c₂₂
     - **Member thickness** — depth of concrete element

     <Tip>
       Edge distances significantly affect capacity. Clariti will warn you if your geometry causes reductions.
     </Tip>
  5. **Set Concrete Strength**

     Define the concrete properties:
     - **Concrete strength class** (e.g., C30/37)
     - **Concrete condition** — cracked or uncracked
  6. **Configure Lever Arm (Optional)**

     If your design includes a lever arm:
     - **Lever Arm** — Enable or disable lever arm consideration
     - **Degree of Restraint** — Value between 1 and 2 (1 = pinned, 2 = fully fixed)
  7. **Configure Reinforcement Options**

     Specify the reinforcement in your concrete element:
     - **Reinforcement density** — widely spaced or closely spaced
     - **Splitting reinforcement** — present or not
     - **Edge reinforcement** — none, straight edge, or straight edge with stirrups
  8. **Run Optimization**

     Click the **Run Optimization** button to calculate the optimal design based on your inputs. After entering all required parameters (marked with *), the optimization will run in seconds.
  9. **Review Calculations**

     A pop-up will display a summary of your calculation results showing:
     - **Max Tension Utilisation** — Percentage and controlling failure mode
     - **Max Shear Utilisation** — Percentage and controlling failure mode
     - **Max Combined Utilisation** — Percentage for combined loading
     
     Click **Ask AI** to get AI assistance with understanding your design, or **View Results** to see the full breakdown in the Results panel.
     
     <Tip>
       Use the **Chat** tab at the bottom of the screen to ask the AI assistant questions about your design at any time.
     </Tip>
  10. **Export Your Specification**

     Once satisfied, export your work:
     - **PDF Report** — full calculation package for checking/approval
     - **3D Models** — download directly from the software
