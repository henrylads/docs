---

## A

**Anchor Channel**
A steel channel with integrated anchors cast into concrete. Allows attachment points to be positioned anywhere along the channel length using T-bolts.

**Anchor**
The embedded portion of the fastening system that transfers loads into the concrete. In anchor channels, anchors are welded to or integral with the channel profile.

**Area Ratio (A<sub>c,N</sub>/A°<sub>c,N</sub>)**
The ratio of actual projected failure area to reference failure area. Reduced by edges, spacing, and member thickness limitations.

## B

**Blow-out**
A concrete failure mode where the cover concrete between the anchor and a nearby surface fails. Relevant for shallow cover conditions.

**Bond**
The adhesive or mechanical connection between an anchor and the surrounding concrete. In cast-in channels, bond is primarily mechanical.

## C

**Cast-in**
Fasteners placed in formwork before concrete is poured, as opposed to post-installed fasteners installed in hardened concrete.

**Characteristic Resistance (R<sub>k</sub>)**
The resistance value with a 5% probability of not being achieved. Used as the basis for design resistance calculations.

**Combined Loading**
Simultaneous application of tension and shear forces, requiring interaction checks per EN 1992-4.

**Concrete Cone Failure**
A tension failure mode where a cone of concrete breaks out around the anchor. Often the governing mode for anchor channel design.

**Concrete Edge Failure**
A shear failure mode where concrete breaks out toward a free edge when shear acts toward that edge.

**Cracked Concrete**
Concrete assumed to have cracks passing through the anchor location under service conditions. Default assumption for most designs.

**Critical Edge Distance (c<sub>cr</sub>)**
The edge distance below which capacity reductions occur. c<sub>cr,N</sub> = 1.5 × h<sub>ef</sub> for tension.

**Critical Spacing (s<sub>cr</sub>)**
The anchor spacing below which capacity reductions due to overlapping failure cones occur. s<sub>cr,N</sub> = 3 × h<sub>ef</sub> for tension.

## D

**Design Resistance (R<sub>d</sub>)**
The calculated resistance value for design purposes. R<sub>d</sub> = R<sub>k</sub> / γ<sub>M</sub>.

**Design Action (E<sub>d</sub>)**
The factored load or load effect to be resisted. Determined from structural analysis.

**Ductile Failure**
Failure mode with significant deformation before fracture, typically steel failure modes.

## E

**Eccentricity**
Offset between the point of load application and the centroid of the anchor group. Causes non-uniform load distribution.

**Edge Distance (c)**
The distance from the center of an anchor to the nearest concrete edge. c₁ and c₂ typically denote distances to perpendicular edges.

**Effective Embedment Depth (h<sub>ef</sub>)**
The depth from the concrete surface to the effective load transfer point of the anchor. Critical parameter for concrete capacity.

**EN 1992-4**
European standard for design of fastenings for use in concrete. The primary reference for anchor channel design in Europe.

**ETA (European Technical Assessment)**
Product-specific approval document containing design data, installation requirements, and performance characteristics for anchor channels.

## F

**Failure Mode**
A specific mechanism by which a fastening system can fail (e.g., steel tension, concrete cone, pullout).

**Factored Load**
Load multiplied by appropriate partial safety factors (γ<sub>F</sub>) for design purposes.

## G

**Governing Failure Mode**
The failure mode with the highest utilization ratio, limiting the overall capacity of the connection.

**Group Effect**
Reduction in capacity when multiple anchors are close together, causing overlapping failure cones or stress fields.

## H

**HDG (Hot-Dip Galvanized)**
Corrosion protection process where steel is coated with zinc by immersion in molten zinc bath.

**h<sub>min</sub>**
Minimum member thickness required for a fastening system to achieve its stated capacity.

## I

**Influence Length (l<sub>i</sub>)**
The length of anchor channel engaged by a point load. l<sub>i</sub> = min(12 × h<sub>ef</sub>, 2 × c).

**Interaction**
The combined effect of tension and shear forces, typically checked using interaction equations.

## L

**Limit State Design**
Design philosophy comparing factored loads (actions) against factored resistances. ULS checks safety; SLS checks serviceability.

**Load Combination**
Combination of different load types (dead, live, wind, etc.) with appropriate factors per EN 1990.

## M

**Member Thickness (h)**
The depth of the concrete element receiving the fastening.

## N

**N<sub>Ed</sub>**
Design value of tension force (kN).

**N<sub>Rd</sub>**
Design resistance in tension (kN).

## P

**Partial Safety Factor (γ)**
Factor applied to characteristic values to account for uncertainties. γ<sub>M</sub> for materials, γ<sub>F</sub> for loads.

**Post-installed**
Fasteners installed in hardened concrete, as opposed to cast-in fasteners.

**Pryout**
A concrete failure mode where concrete breaks out on the back side of the anchor under shear loading. Relevant for short, stiff anchors.

**Pullout**
A failure mode where the anchor pulls out of the concrete without forming a full breakout cone.

## R

**Reinforcement, Supplementary**
Reinforcement specifically designed to resist fastener loads and increase concrete breakout capacity.

**Resistance**
The capacity of a structural element to resist load, expressed as force (kN) or moment (kNm).

## S

**Serviceability Limit State (SLS)**
Design verification for normal use conditions — deflection, cracking, durability. Less critical than ULS for anchor design.

**Shear**
Force acting perpendicular to the anchor axis, parallel to the concrete surface.

**Splitting**
A concrete failure mode where the concrete splits due to wedging action of the anchor, particularly in thin members or near edges.

**Stainless Steel**
Corrosion-resistant steel alloy containing chromium. Common grades for anchor channels: 1.4301 (304), 1.4404 (316L).

## T

**T-bolt**
A bolt with a T-shaped head designed to slide into and lock within an anchor channel. The primary fixing component for connections to channels.

**Tension**
Force acting along the anchor axis, away from the concrete surface.

**Torque**
Rotational force applied when tightening T-bolts. Specified to ensure proper clamping without damage.

## U

**Ultimate Limit State (ULS)**
Design verification for structural safety — ensuring loads don't exceed capacities with adequate reliability.

**Uncracked Concrete**
Concrete where cracks are not expected to occur through the anchor location. Higher capacity but requires justification.

**Utilization Ratio (η)**
The ratio of design action to design resistance. η = E<sub>d</sub> / R<sub>d</sub>. Must be ≤ 1.0 for adequate design.

## V

**V<sub>Ed</sub>**
Design value of shear force (kN).

**V<sub>Rd</sub>**
Design resistance in shear (kN).

## ψ (Psi) Factors

**ψ<sub>s,N</sub>**
Reduction factor for edge distance effects on tension capacity.

**ψ<sub>re,N</sub>**
Factor accounting for presence (or absence) of supplementary reinforcement for tension.
