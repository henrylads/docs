Anchor channels are available in various configurations to suit different applications. This page describes the available variants and when to use each.

## Material Variants

### Hot-Dip Galvanized (HDG)

**Description:**
Steel channel and anchors coated with zinc through hot-dip galvanizing process.

**Properties:**
- Zinc coating: 45-85 μm typical
- Corrosion protection: Sacrificial zinc layer
- Color: Silver-grey, may dull over time

**Applications:**
- Internal dry environments (XC1)
- Protected external (with additional coating)
- Cost-sensitive projects

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for marine environments
- Limited life in high humidity
- Potential galvanic issues with stainless fixings

### Stainless Steel 1.4301 (304)

**Description:**
Austenitic stainless steel with good general corrosion resistance.

**Composition:**
- Chromium: 17-19%
- Nickel: 8-10%
- Carbon: < 0.08%

**Applications:**
- External building facades
- Moderate humidity environments (XC3)
- Food processing (non-chloride)

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for chloride exposure
- Can pit in stagnant water
- Less resistant than 1.4404

### Stainless Steel 1.4404 (316L)

**Description:**
Molybdenum-alloyed austenitic stainless steel with superior corrosion resistance.

**Composition:**
- Chromium: 16-18%
- Nickel: 10-14%
- Molybdenum: 2-3%
- Carbon: < 0.03% (L = low carbon)

**Applications:**
- Marine environments (XS classes)
- Swimming pools and water features
- Chemical exposure
- High-specification facades

**Advantages:**
- Excellent chloride resistance
- Pitting resistance (PREN > 23)
- Weldable without sensitization

### Stainless Steel 1.4571 (316Ti)

**Description:**
Titanium-stabilized version of 316 stainless steel.

**Composition:**
- As 1.4404, plus
- Titanium: 5 × C to 0.70%

**Applications:**
- High-temperature applications
- Weld-intensive fabrication
- Specialized industrial

**Advantages:**
- Stabilized against sensitization
- Better high-temperature properties
- Equivalent corrosion resistance to 1.4404

<Tip>
  For most facade and external applications, 1.4404 provides the best
  balance of corrosion resistance and availability.

## Length Variants

### Standard Lengths

Channels are supplied in standard lengths:

| Length | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| 1.0 m | Small projects, cut-to-length |
| 2.0 m | Most common, minimal waste |
| 3.0 m | Long runs, fewer joints |
| 6.0 m | Maximum standard, bulk supply |

### Cut-to-Length

Channels can be cut to specific lengths:

**Advantages:**
- Minimize site cutting
- Reduce waste
- Precise fit to design

**Minimum lengths:**
- Typically 100 mm minimum
- Must accommodate required T-bolt positions
- Allow for tolerance in casting

<Note>
  Order cut-to-length for projects with many identical connections.
  The setup cost is offset by reduced site work and waste.
</Note>

## Anchor Configurations

### Standard Anchor Spacing

| Profile | Standard Spacing | Min. Spacing |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| CPRO 38/23 | 125 mm | 100 mm |
| CPRO 52/34 | 125 mm | 100 mm |
| CPRO 72/48 | 150 mm | 125 mm |
| ATA 28/15 | 100 mm | 75 mm |
| ATA 38/23 | 125 mm | 100 mm |

### Custom Anchor Spacing

Available for special applications:

- **Closer spacing**: Higher capacity per length
- **Wider spacing**: Cost reduction, sufficient for light loads
- **Variable spacing**: Optimized for specific load patterns

Request custom spacing through your supplier.

### Anchor End Conditions

| Configuration | Description | Use |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Full anchor at end | Anchor within 50mm of channel end | Maximum capacity |
| Half anchor at end | Anchor cut at channel end | Standard supply |
| No end anchor | First anchor set back from end | Special applications |

## Channel End Options

### Plain Cut End

Standard finish:
- Factory cut or site cut
- Deburr for safety
- Suitable for most applications

### End Caps

Plastic or metal caps:
- Close channel opening
- Prevent concrete ingress during casting
- Aesthetic finish for exposed channels

### Welded End Plates

For structural continuity:
- Plate welded to channel end
- Transfers forces to adjacent structure
- Requires engineering coordination

## Surface Treatments

### Standard Finish

As-manufactured:
- HDG: Zinc coating
- Stainless: Mill finish or pickled

### Painted

For color matching or additional protection:
- Powder coating over HDG
- Paint system over stainless (rare)
- Color matching to facade

### Passivated

For stainless steel:
- Removes free iron from surface
- Enhances corrosion resistance
- Standard for marine applications
